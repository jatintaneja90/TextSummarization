Human heart beats one hundred thousand times sending two thousand gallons of blood everyday Heart has the job of keeping blood flowing through sixty thousand miles of tissues
Blood vessels have arteries veins capilaries
Heart has four chambers left atrium , right atrium , left ventricle , right ventricle
Heart has four one way valves Tricuspid valve , mitral valve, aortic valve, pulmonic valve
viens carry oxygenated blood from lungs to the left atrium.
when left atrium relaxes,the blood is pumped into the heart.when left atrium contractes, it pushes the blood into left ventricle.when left ventricle contractes it pushes the blood into aorta which carries blood to different parts of the body
Viens carry deoxygenated blood to the heart and it enters the right atrium and which pushes into the right ventricle on contraction.
Ventricle pushes the deoxygenated blood in pulmonary artery and crries to lungs and oxygenate the blood again.
