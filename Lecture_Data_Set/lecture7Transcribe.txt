Finding a way to store, distribute and manage all of your data is a big challenge
 Running applications delivering content to users hosting high traffic websites or backing up documents, databases and email all require a lot of storage and the need for more storage space keeps growing every day
 Building and maintaining your own storage repository is expensive and time consuming
 First you have to buy racks and racks of dedicated hardware and software
 Then to get it all up and running, you have to hire staff and set up complex processes to make sure your storage is performing well and backed up in case something fails, adding more capacity costs, money and time to deploy more servers, hard drives and tape backup machines and guessing how much capacity you need in the future is difficult
Getting this wrong means either of not having the storage you need or overspending and ending up with excess capacity that sit idle
