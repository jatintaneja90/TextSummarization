You can feel your heart thudding away every time you put your hand to your chest
But do you have any idea what's really going on in there or what keeps your heart ticking as it should every day your heart beats about one hundred thousand times sending two thousand gallons of blood surging through your body
Although it's no bigger than your fist, your heart has the mighty job of keeping the blood flowing through sixty thousand miles of blood vessels that feed your organs and tissues food, water and oxygen are essential for the existence of human life
Blood transports all these substances through various channels called blood vessels
Blood vessels involves arteries veins capilaries 
To keep the blood flowing through at our bonnie we have a pumping system and the heart is the pump, which is composed of muscle that pumps blood throughout the body, beating approximately seventy two times per minute of our lives
The human heart has four chambers, the right atrium, the left atrium, the right ventricle and the left ventricle
There are four valves in the heart
These valves are Custom valve, mitral valve, aortic valve, pulmonic valve
These valves are one way valves now you have seen the structure of the heart
Let us find out how it works
The blood becomes oxygen rich by absorbing oxygen in the lungs 
the function of the heart starts one oxygenated blood is carried from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart by means of the pulmonary veins the left atrium relaxes this blood is pumped into the heart when the left atrium contracts the left ventricle relaxes simultaneously the left atrium pushes the blood into the left ventricle through the one way valve 
when the left ventricle contracts that blood is pumped into the aorta which carries oxygenated blood to the different parts of the body except the lungs oxygenated blood reaches the different parts of the body through the blood vessels called the arteries 
the arteries gets branched into capital aries which then reaches to the different organs of the bonnie the blood and becomes the oxygenated 
the blood capital area's gets mixed inform thicker blood vessels called the veins 
the veins carried the oxygenated blood to the heart the blood vessels that carried the oxygenated blood heart are known as the van akhatova 
the de oxygenated blood from different parts of body enters the upper right chamber of the heart which is called the right atrium 
the right atrium gets contracted allowing the blood to flow into the right ventricle which contracts with the expansion of the right atrium through the one way valve 
the right ventricle than contracts pushing the blood into the pulmonary artery the pulmonary artery carries the de oxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation 
the lungs oxygenates the blood by exchanging of gases and flows back into the heart through the pulmonary vein and starts the circulatory cycle all over again
