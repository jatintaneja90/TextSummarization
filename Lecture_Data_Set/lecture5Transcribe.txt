Our solar system is one of over five hundred known solar systems in the entire milky way galaxy 
solar system came into being about four point five billion years ago when a cloud of interstellar gas and dust collapsed, resulting in a solar nebula a swirling disk of material that collided to form the solar system
 The solar system is located in the milky way's ryan star cluster on lee fifteen percent of stars in the galaxy host planetary systems and one of those stars is our own son 
 revolving around the sun are eight planets 
 the planets are divided into two categories based on their composition terrestrial and jovian 
 terrestrial planets including mercury, venus, earth and mars are primarily made of rocky material
 Their services are solid, they don't have ring systems, they have very few or no moons and they are relatively small
 The smallest and closest to the sun is mercury, which has the shortest orbit in the solar system at about three earth months
 Venus is the hottest planet with temperatures of up to eight hundred sixty seven degrees fahrenheit due to an atmosphere of carbon dioxide and extensive lava flows
 Next to this world of fire is a world of water earth water systems on this planet helped create the only known environment in the universe capable of sustaining life 
 the last of the terrestrial planets mars might have also supported life about three point seven a billion years ago when the planet had a watery surface and moist atmosphere 
 beyond the four terrestrial planets of the inner solar system lie that jovian planets of the outer solar system 
 the jovian planets include gas giants jupiter and saturn and ice giant it's uranus and neptune the gas giants are predominantly made of helium and hydrogen and the ice giants also contained rock eyes and a liquid mixture of water, methane and ammonia
 All four jovian planets have multiple moons sport ring systems have no solid surface and are immense 
 the largest jovian is also the largest planet in the solar system jupiter nearby is saturn 
 the solar system's second largest planet its signature rings are wide enough to fit between earth and the moon but are barely a kilometer thick past saturn are the ice giants uranus and neptune the slightly bigger of these ice giants 
 uranus is famous for rotating on its side next uranus is neptune the outermost planet in the solar system and also one of the coldest orbiting the terrestrial planets is the asteroid belt a flat disk of rocky objects full of remnants from the solar system's formacion from microscopic dust particles to the largest known object 
 the dwarf planet siri's another disc of space debris lies much further out and orbits the jovian planets the icy copperbelt 
 apart from asteroids, the kiper belt is also home to dwarf planets such as plato and is the birthplace of many comments beyond the keiper belt is the or cloud, a vast spirit, kal collection of icy debris
 It is considered the edge of the solar system, since that is where the gravitational and physical influences of the sun end our solar system's particular configuration of planets and other celestial objects, all revolving around a life giving star
 Make it a special place to call home
