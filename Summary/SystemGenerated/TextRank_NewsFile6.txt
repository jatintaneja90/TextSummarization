Banking stocks suffered a day of volatility as the morning's wave of market turmoil wiped 2.5 per cent from the value of the FTSE 100 Index.
Recession fears and speculation of a short-term funding crisis in the European banking system ensured the top flight index remained under pressure after losing £62 billion or 4.5 per cent yesterday.
The FTSE 100 fell as low as 4929.5 before steadying later in the session to stand 129 points lower at 4963.1. Traders were braced for another slump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after it closed more than 3 per cent lower last night.
The tumbling figures were mirrored by European markets, with Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan stock markets, also showing losses.
