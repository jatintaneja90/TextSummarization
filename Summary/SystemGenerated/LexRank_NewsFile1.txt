Nasa has also announced details of plans to determine if Mars has or ever had the ingredients for life.
Touchdown point: Nasa's rover will land at Mars' Gale crater in August 2012
Beyond all those obstacles, Nasa doesn't even know which asteroid would be the best place to visit.
The story begins with why Nasa would want to go to an asteroid. The agency has sent small spacecraft off to study asteroids over the years and even landed on one in 2001.
Logistically, Nasa wants to go to Mars, but that is distant and more difficult. So the argument is that going to an asteroid is a better testing ground than returning to the moon.
If Nasa can get astronauts to an asteroid, they can figure out a way of changing a potential killer's orbit. They'll experiment with the safe one they land on, Mr Braun said.
Meanwhile Nasa is pursuing its concept for a mini-spaceship exploration vehicle, about the size of a minivan. And it's planning an underwater lab for training, an effort to mimic an asteroid mission's challenges.
