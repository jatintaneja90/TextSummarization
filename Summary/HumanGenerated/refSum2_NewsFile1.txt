NASA is trying to develop the capabilities needed to send humans to an aestroid by 2025 and also to Mars. 
This looks like a mission with lots of obstacles and challenges to overcome.
Although the robotic explorers have studied  Mars for a long time and come accross a bunch of information researchers  are still hoping to learn if Mars has or even had the organics necessary for life. 
For reaching they are considering various solutions for issues  like difficulties for landing due to gravity, the kind of shuttle needed to get within the working distance of rocks, the size of the space craft , which aestroid to land on etc. All this has to be ready before 2025.
As Mars is further away from aestroid , going to aestroid would be a better test in ground
