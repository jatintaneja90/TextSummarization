so in this next segment i am going to describe context free gravity

which are a very important formalism used within the poles

and roll

so first give a formal definition and

so i should know is that context free grammars are not only using linguistics

they're also a central importance in computer science both theoretical computer science and also in programming languages

they play it very very important role so a contests we grammar has the following component so complex free gravity is a full to pull because this thing of an signal and

where we have the following elements of this to paul so and is going to be a finite set of what we call non terminal symbols signal is going to be a finite set of water called terminal symbols

our as a set of rules come back to this and a second

finally is some member of and which is referred to as a distinguished or stalled simple in the grammar

so we each of these rules takes the following form we have all the on the left hand re sighted the rule

essex who has to be a non terminal and then on the right hand side of the rule

we have a sequence of items why one through i am way each of these wise can either be a non terminal and or it can be nellum

mt of sigmar notice that and could beauty

there are so actually this right hand side of the rule could just be but we often right is epsilon which is the empty sequence of sequence slowing lengths hero

so that's a very abstract definition let me give you a concrete examples

why

so here is an extremely simple grammar

so for english but his useful and illustrating the definition that i to show you

so i have before elements of the context re grammy here and as sigma or and are so in in this case as they said as a finite he said

of what are called non terminals so we have some bowls like that

they see appearing in those palace trees i showed you earlier and that is we also have please

each things like beat the feet and and i am these are actually going to people's of speech in a grammar

they're distinguish stop stop simple is simply going to be

and then finally we have a said of words in the language so sigma or my consist of the following a set of words which we have a very small the camp or hear more mystic grammar would they have a much much logic for cab barry

and sorry i finally we have a set of rules so here are the rules in this particular example

grammar and as i said on the left hand side of the rule i we see a non terminal for example less

with or empty emptier

and so on and on the right hand side of beat rule i see a sequence of zero war symbol to reach symbols

would be any a month for an early sigma so in particular have less goes

here it goes to the idea because it and so on and so on

over here i have rules we're actually the left hand side is a single simple for example the eye and the right hand side is a word for example sleeps

so this is one simple example grammar later in the class will took a lot more

these different symbols mean but just briefly s basic stance for sentence fee as an appreciation for the praise and peers and now praise peep here's a professional phrase and so on and so on

[SMACK]

so that's a formal definition of context for grammars and also an example

particular context for grammar the next crucial

and it is going to be the idea of a derivation will more specific more specifically what's called a left most of

so a derivation is a sequence of strings

to on through yes and where the speakers have strings has the following property so as one has to be equal to this distinguished stop simple in grammar

as in has to be made up of elements of singer learn so a star is just the set of all possible

so strings which could be derived from sigma or so if i have sigar is the

then

lessig mr are includes strains like just an empty string absalom

will the earth
